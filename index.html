            <p>
                In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are 
                trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very 
                important to understand how to structure documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some 
                images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes 
                from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.

            <h3 id="Text Body Head">Text Body Head</h3>
            <p>
                You met the 'body' element in the first example we created.
                Everything inside this element is shown inside the main
                browser window.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the 'body' element you will often see a 'head'
                element. This contains information about the page (rather than
                information that is shown within the main part of the browser
                window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
                You will usually find a 'title' element inside the 'head'
                element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The contents of the 'title' element are either shown in the
                top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL
                of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if
                your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at
                the same time)
            </p>

        </div>

            <h3 id="List">List</h3>
            <p>
                HTML provides us with three different types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For 
                    example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed 
                    in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a 
                    section number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than 
                    characters that indicate order).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for 
                    each of those terms.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="Links">Links</h3>
            <p>
                Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move 
                from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or 
                surfing.
                You will commonly come across the following types of links:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Links from one website to another </li>
                <li>Links from one page to another on the same website </li>
                <li>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page </li>
                <li>Links that open in a new browser window </li>
                <li>Links that start up your email program and address a new email to 
                someone</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2 id="Intro to CSS">Intro to CSS</h2>
            <p>
                The key to understanding how CSS works 
                is to imagine that there is an invisible box 
                around every HTML element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'link' element can be used in an HTML document 
                to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to 
                style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does 
                not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the element. It 
                should use three attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Href: This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is 
                    often placed in a folder called css or styles)</li>
                <li>Type: This attribute specifies the type of document 
                    being linked to. The value should be text/css</li>
                <li>Rel: This specifies the relationship between the HTML 
                    page and the file it is linked to. The value should be 
                    stylesheet when linking to a CSS file</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3 id="Types of Variables">Types of Variables</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatically</li>
                    <li>Using var</li>
                    <li>Using let</li>
                    <li>Using const</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                They all have their differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
                It should only be used in code written for older browsers.
                In simple words, this keyword is used for declaring variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
                const is used to declare constants values that cannot be changed,
                so this keyword is used in declaring values that shouldn't change
                values or types.
            </p>
            <p>
                The let keyword is used when you cannot use const, is a newer keyword
                than var and therefore shouldn't be used if you need support for older
                browsers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="Types of Values">Types of Values</h3>
            <p>
                There are three types of values:
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers</li>
                    <li>Strings</li>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Numbers are used for aritmetical operations and to represent numeric
                values. Numbers can be divided, multiplied, or subtracted
            </p>
            <p>
                Strings are used to represent text. They are written by 
                enclosing their content in quotes. Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted;
                but using the + operator can be used on them, not to add, 
                but to concatenate—to glue two strings together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals, can do a few more tricks. Apart from being 
able to         span lines, they can also embed other values
            </p>
            <p>
                Boolean values have just two values, true and false, written as those 
                words.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="Logical Operators">Logical Operators</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or, and not. These can be used to “reason” about Booleans.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to 
                    it are true.</li>
                <li>The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.</li>
                <li>Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it—!true produces 
                    false and !false gives true</li>
                <li>The last logical operator we will look at is not unary, not binary, but ternary, operating on three values. It is 
                    written with a question mark and a colon, like this: <br>
                    <p class="indent">> console.log(condition ? iftrue : iffalse)</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="Short-circuiting of logical operators">Short-circuiting of logical operators</h3>
            <p>
                The logical operators && and || handle values of different types in a peculiar way
            </p>
            <p>
                They will convert the value on their left side to Boolean type in order to decide what to do, but depending on 
                the operator and the result of that conversion, they will return either the original left-hand value or the right-hand value.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                > console.log(null || "user") <br>
                > // → user <br>
                > console.log("Agnes" || "user") <br>
                > // → Agnes <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that 0, NaN, and the empty string ("") 
                count as false, while all the other values count as true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ?? operator resembles ||, but returns the value on the right only if the one on the left is null or undefined, 
                not if it is some other value that can be converted to false. Often, this is preferable to the behavior of ||.

            <h3 id="Intro Functions">Intro Functions</h3>
            <p>
                Functions are one of the most central tools in JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of 
                program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to 
                associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 id="REGEX">REGEX</h4>
            <p>
                This regex, "/(+|-|\x|/)/", is a regular expression that matches one of the following characters: +, -, x, or /. Let me explain each part of the regular expression:
                <ul>
                    <li>/: This indicates the start of the regular expression.</li>
                    <li>( and ): These parentheses are used to group multiple options within the regular expression. In this case, they group the four operators (+, -, x, /) together.</li>
                    <li>+, -, \x, /: These are the characters of the operators (+, -, x, /). The operators + and / are escaped with a backslash \ because otherwise they would have a special meaning in a regular expression.</li>
                    <li>|: The pipe | is an operator that means "or", indicating that any of the options can be a match.</li>
                    <li>/: This indicates the end of the regular expression.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 id="Switch">Switch</h4>
            <p>
                The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case 
                clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement 
                is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the 
                expression's value
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 id="Loops">Loops</h4>
            <p>
                There are 3 types of loops in javascript:
                <ul>
                    <li>for</li>
                    <li>while</li>
                    <li>do-while</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a
                block of code. It consists of three parts:initialization, condition, and iteration.
                <p class="indent">
                    > for (initialization; condition; iteration) { <br>
                    >     // code to be executed <br>
                    > }
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>initialization: It initializes the loop control variable.</li>
                    <li>condition: It defines the condition for executing the loop. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.</li>
                    <li>iteration: It updates the loop control variable after each iteration.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The while loop is used when you don't know how many times you want to execute
                a block of code but have a condition to check.
                <p class="indent">
                    > while (condition) { <br>
                    >     // code to be executed <br>
                    > }
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The loop will keep executing the block of code as long as the condition evaluates to true.

                The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the block of code is
                executed at least once before checking the condition.
                <p class="indent">
                    > do { <br>
                    >     // code to be executed <br>
                    > } while (condition);
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The block of code is executed first, and then the condition is checked. If the condition is true,
                the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.
