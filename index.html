            <p>Neural networks are a cool blend of biology and computer science, inspired by our brain’s setup to tackle complicated computing tasks. Essentially, they’re algorithms designed to spot patterns and make sense of sensory data, which lets them do a ton of stuff like recognizing faces, understanding spoken words, making predictions, and understanding natural language.</p>
